# How to contribute
1. You can contribute in terms of Code
2. You can contribute in terms of improving Documentation
## Following the procedure you can make your contribution with ease.
### Step 1
Look in the issues if the change you are doing is available and issues section is it assigned to someone or not if you can't find any issue open one. Anyone from our team will assign you the issue then you can start contributing
### step 2 Fork this repository
You can fork this repository by clicking on fork button on top right corner. Once you fork this will create a copy of repo on your account

### step 3 Clone the repository 
To clone the repository go to your account open this repo and either click on clone button or run the command below to get this repository on your local machine

> git clone "URL you just copied"

e.g. git clone https://github.com/yourgithubusername/first_contribution.git

### step 4 Create a branch
On your local machine go the project folder that you cloned and use following git command inside that folder

create a new branch using below command

git checkout -b

e.g. git checkout -b <branch-name>

### step 4 Lets make some contributions
Make changes to files on your local machine work on the issue you're assigned. 

### step 5 Add Changes and Commit Changes
Now we have to add changes that we made to the branch so for that we will run following command

git add .

Now we have to commit changes, commit message should always be clear, to commit use command below

git commit -m "resolved the <issue>"

### step 6 Push changes to GitHub
Now we have to push the changes that we made to remote repository on specified branch to do so use command below

git push origin <branch name>

name of branch is same as you created in step 3

### step 7 Submit your changes for review
Once you have pushed your code to GitHub, now it's time to create pull request, you will go to the repository click on compare and pull request and submit the pull request.

Soon, we will be merging all your pull requests to the main branch of project and you will also get notification once your pull request is merged with existing code base. After that you will be able to see your details in contributor section on the page below
